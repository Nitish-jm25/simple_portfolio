<h1>Best anime of my watchlist</h1>
<h2>my top 3</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>It's one of the good action anime i have seen in my anime journey</p>
<h3>2. Death note</h3>
<p>this is my first anime and its been my all time favourite crime thriller show</p>
<h3>3. Code geas</h3>
<p>its a similar kind of genre as AOT but the ending was very much satisfied and its an combinaton of emotions and action</p>
